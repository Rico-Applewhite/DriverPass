# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass project, our client wants to take advantage of the untapped market by offering driving lessons for those hoping to get a license. For that to
happen they wanted me to design a system that would not only allow their customers to make reservations to practice but also be able to have a central location where
their instructor can leave feedback and even practice taking the written part of the test. The system also had to account for the DriverPass employees. Have to
code it so each individual is only allowed certain access to the system depending on their job title.


What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did great work with the diagrams in the system design document. They show what the system intends to do and provides a good foundation to begin 
coding the system.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Some aspects of the business requirement could be improved. I would go into more nonfunctional requirement details. As well as do a tad more research on possible platform 
constraints.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user will be using this system the most so I needed it easy to navigate it. A horrible user experience will make the user not want to use the system at all.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

An important approach to designing software is to always listen to the client's needs. Asking questions and getting as much information from the client as 
possible will give you a glimpse of what they envisioned.
